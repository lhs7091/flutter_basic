## Google Mobile Ads for Flutter

This guide is intended for publishers who want to monetize a Flutter app.

Integrating Google Mobile Ads SDK into a Flutter app, which you will do here, is the first step towards displaying AdMob ads and earning revenue. Once the integration is complete, you can choose an ad format to get detailed implementation steps.

The Google Mobile Ads SDK for Flutter currently supports loading and displaying banner, interstitial (full-screen), native ads, and rewarded video ads.

Note: This plugin also contains support for Google Ad Manager. If you are interested in creating and loading an Ad with Ad Manager, you may follow the same prerequisites, platform setup, mobile ads SDK initialization steps outlined in this doc, and then see creating and loading an ad with Ad Manager for further instructions.

See also the codelab for inline ads in Flutter for a detailed guide on setting inline banner and native ads.
